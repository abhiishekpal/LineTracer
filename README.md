# LineTracer
Convert Any Image Plot to a Digital Plot. The Code contains a model that can be adapted to plots from any domain, in the process Make sure the traced line is most optimal to your objective.

This is a Q-Learning Based Algorithm. Where we traverse the plot from a point and find the path that leads to a minimum loss in reconstruction. In the process avoiding artifacts and noises.
